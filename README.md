# Gdscript Neural Network Experiment
Very basic Neural Network (inference only) implementation in Gdscript (Godot Engine).


This was written for learning purposes and experimenting with basic neural networks.
There is no training functionality in the release, and the calculations are not optimized in any way.

It supports adding linear/tanh layers into a sequential operation, and it can calculate an array with the results, given an input array.

### DISCLAIMER: 
Not tested much yet, inacurrate results or other errors might happen. 
Not recommended for production, no warranties of any kind provided.
Written for Godot 4.3.stable, it may or may not work in other versions.
