# Gdscript Neural Network Experiment
Very basic Neural Network (inference only) implementation in Gdscript (Godot Engine).

This was written for learning purposes and experimenting with basic neural networks.
There is no training functionality in the release, and the calculations are not optimized in any way.

It supports adding a linear layer, and/or a tanh layer, an can calculate an array containing the results, given an input array.
